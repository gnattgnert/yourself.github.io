The Birth of Yourself:
A collection of poems by Julia Daher.

Intended originally as just a text document on my computer, used only as a journal and nothing more,
I realized I could post it online to a small audience and it not really change much other than having something in my arsenal
for when I want to show people my writing but don't have my computer on hand.
This is an archival thing. I've written loads more poems, btu they've all been lost to time by now.
Gone, forever, into the aether.
So, in order to show people what I've made without needing to do anything major and also to not lose all my hard fucking work at the flip of a switch,
Here is 
my collection.
